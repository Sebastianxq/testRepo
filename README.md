# testRepo
Repository used to store miscellaneous files from multiple languages that I have lightly touched on. Any language here should be expected to be reasonably understood. Current Languages and their respective files, along with a short description of the file, can be found below. 


_Note: Files in this repository should be considered skeletal versions that are used for the purpose of exploring programming languages only, unless otherwise stated_

* **C++**
  
  helloWorld.c
  > A hello World File
  
  4Convergence.cpp
  >Shows the values leading to the convergence of a specific algorithm

* **Bash Scripting** 

  decryptMsg_Bash.sh
  > A skeleton of commands that filters out mismatching parts of an input text to retrieve the codex for a message.
