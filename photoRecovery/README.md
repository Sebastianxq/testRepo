This folder is currently a placeholder for one of the extracurricular projects that I plan to work on during the summer.

Project Requirements
	-A script that is able to detect all formats of picture/videos within a computer
	-For now, creates a new folder and stores pictures there. (This can be later translated to account for being encapsulated in an external device)

Additional QoL requirements
	-Allow user to specify where they want to check for pictures from a preset list of specifications (Only most common areas, entire drive, etc)
	-Add a GUI

As part of this project: learnign how to enable scripts on USB insertion would be nice.
