Quick blurbs about the functionality of topster2 that i've noticed. 
Barring any legal issues that may exist: i'd like to one day make a clone of the website due to a difference in opinion (read: I think the guy is a nutjob and want to end his reign in the mucore scene)


1.)Multiple renders for your topster can be made at once. (this did result in a bug where the rendering load button continued for png)
2.)exports are done in JSON, everything is encoded into some form of string that then gets decoded by the system.
3.)The search engine either uses a modified search query to weed out the non-relevant searches, is built from the ground up to scrape only music images or is reading from some 
  DB that only stores music stuff (Further testing needs to be done to see how this fares against more obscure albums that wouldn't be found in traditional streaming platforms
4.)There's an option for movies too (untested).
